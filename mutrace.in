COMMANDS:
  -h, --help                      Show this help

OPTIONS:
      --hash-size=INTEGER         Set size of mutex hash table
      --frames=INTEGER            Set number of frames to show in stack traces
  -d, --debug-info                Make use of debug information in stack traces
      --max=INTEGER               Show this many mutexes at maximum
      --order=STRING              Order the summary table by this column (see
                                  below for valid column names)

      --locked-min=INTEGER        Only show mutexes that have been locked at
                                  least this often
      --owner-changed-min=INTEGER Only show mutexes whose owning thread changed
                                  at least this often
      --contended-min=INTEGER     Only show mutexes which have been contended
                                  at least this often
      --all                       Show all mutexes, overrides the values of the
                                  three values above

  -r, --track-rt                  Track for each mutex if it was accessed from
                                  a realtime thread
      --trap                      Trigger a debugger trap each time a mutex
                                  inconsistency is detected (for use in
                                  conjunction with gdb)
